www.renatogr.cf Desktop 4.3 is out!
Yes, i finally released rgd 4.3 after delay of 23 DAYS!! Almost a month
it has been in development for like 2 or 3 months? IDK but that doesnt
matter it matters that its out!! I will now begin working on 4.4 i already
have some plans but i'll not leak anything yet. Expect it by next year bcs
i'll do a redisigning too and that takes time sooooo yeah. 

Go on tab "Apps" download it and follow instalation instructions and good luck!



Thanks for using my services <3
