December 3rd 2022

It is barely a 2 weeks after a release of rgd 4.3 and 4.4 is already announced. Don't worry it wont take 3 months to make this version but don't expect it this year. Just maybe but maaaaaybe i finish it this year but i don't think so.

Main goal of rgd 4.4 is to improve user experience with my services unlike 4.3 that had to do that and bring a sort of better design and that didn't end very well. So in 4.4 when you download an app you can do all that through the app. Also in 4.3 Testing space was done in less than half a day and it is a complete featureless garbage so in 4.4 testers got a lot better space for reading and tracking changelogs, for the first time i added photo albums, download pages, directories and more. I also fixed search so you can't really see all searchable stuff even you still can but that doesn't matter. Don't expect any better design or resizing ability in 4.4 thats a thing for 4.5.  Also rgd 4.0,4.1,4.2,4.2.1 and 4.3 will stay supported so don't worry u won't have to update even tho i don't see why sticking to anything under 4.3.
