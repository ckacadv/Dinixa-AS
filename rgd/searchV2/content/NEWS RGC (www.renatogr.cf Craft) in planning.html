RGC (www.renatogr.cf Craft) in planning
RGC is a Minecraft server for redstone builds but I will mostly use it for testing purposes like when I complete the telephone system I will do it on there and I will build a bunch of terminals for ppls so if someone want to build a machine or computer and want to communicate with something on other part of the world you just dial the number and connect machine to input and output wires. That is all for now I will inform you on RGC page for future updates
