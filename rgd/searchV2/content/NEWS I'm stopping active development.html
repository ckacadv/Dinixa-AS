I'm stopping active development
April 23rd 2023
I simply got tired of working on all this, and that was a long time ago when the site was half finished and no new programs or news were released. The renatogr.cf domain was registered in June 2021 and that marks the beginning of all this. This whole site and rgd and other applications were just a kind of hobby for me, which I got bored of before the end of 2022. Now I'm releasing the new version of rgd (4.5), which was ready for release 2 months ago. These whole almost 2 years were very fun for me and I will remember them forever. This is not the end of rgd or dinixa, I just wanted to say that I will no longer be actively working on the site and rgd anymore. I will start a new version of rgd and who knows when it will be finished, maybe in a month, maybe in two or more. The problem is that I have lost the will to do this because I know that I am only working for myself and no one will see that. I should have advertised the site when the programs came out every now and then and the site was constantly changing, but I didn't. And now it no longer makes sense to advertise something that has died.
