Why it exists?

It is made as a school project but I made it better and releaced it here. It is used for generating random numbers from 1 to 6 and it has a simple animation when it is running.

 

How to install this app?

Dice app does not come with the installer! Only executable file. You can store it where ever you want. To open it just click the icon. If you are on windows, windows defender will tell you that it is some kind of a trojan and that it can execute remote commands from attacker. That is a false detection this app has nothing to do with internet!

 

How to use Dice?

When you open the app you will see a picture of a dice, start, stop and help button. To generate a random number from 1 to 6 click button Start. To stop it and get the number click Stop button.
