How to install www.renatogr.cf Desktop

www.renatogr.cf Desktop app is a very simple and easy to use app and it does not come with installer. When you download it from www.renatogr.cf Software page just click the icon and app will open and be ready to use. Just one small problem is that if you use windows, windows defender will tell you that it is some kind of a trojan and that it can execute remote commands from attacker. That is a false detection! Only thing that rgd has to do with the internet is loading and displaying web pages.
