How to use Inventar+
24.9.2023.
It is actually pretty simple to use once you learn to use it of course, that is why i wrote this.
After installing the program (instructions on the download page) and opening it you will see a
Sign in page, if you just installed the program that means you dont have any accounts. 

--Adding accounts
To add one you have to press "Account settings",
enter admin password which u setted while installing (default is admin). Enter it and click "Add user" then enter username and
password you want and sign in with that. 

--Adding items
Press the "Add" button in top right corner to open the promt for adding stuff. There you will see "Item name" "Ammount" "Code"  and "Description"
After filling all fields just press "Add" and the item will be added right away

--Editing items
To edirt an item you have to select an item you want to edit, afte the data was displayed "Edit" button should now say "Save" and be green and
fields that are editable will turn blue and you will be able to type in them. When you are done press the save button and the program will save
it to the file.
