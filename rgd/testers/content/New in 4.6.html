What is comming to rgd 4.6
August 27th 2023
4.6 will again be a whole redesign of the app. In this update not just UI but the code will be kinda changed because current versions still have some parts from version 4.0 and most of those thing are not in use anymore or dont work. All that junk is going away and its gonna be a fresh start. Buttons are still on the side, there is a bit more glow on the elements than before. All tabs are redesigned and some have more functions than others. This version will finally bring the encryption to the profiles and some other things to keep things a bit more secure. I will update this "directory" as i add more stuff.
That's it for now i'll keep u updated.

thx for remembering this thing exists
