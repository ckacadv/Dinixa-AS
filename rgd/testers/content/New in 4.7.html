What's new in RGD 4.7
December 5th 2023
---DESIGN
Design is mostly same as it was in 4.6, there are just some little fixes with some UI elements and
stuff like that. Fixed giant widget on the side that was editable for some reason.


---SEARCH TAB
This version is mostly focused on extending the search function that was not updated since it was
introduced except some minor minor fixes. Now it will be able to properly display accounts inclouding
profile pictures, also it will be able to display apps with screenshots, docs and more. To see
exactly what is all new go to Active projects > rgd 4.7
