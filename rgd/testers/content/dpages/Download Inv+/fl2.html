After you downloaded and extracted the zip, you will see a map<br>
called Inventar+. 
 <br>
Copy that folder over to the Documents folder and open it and<br>
right click on file "Inventar+ Offline version" and click<br>
"Create shortcut" and move "Inventar+ Offline version shortcut"<br>
to the desktop or any location you want it to be. If you want<br>
you can rename it to say "Inventar+" by right clicking it and <br>
clickin "Rename"
<br>
After opening the app you have to make an account.<br>
To do that you have to click "Add account" and type in
the admin password (default is admin), after you entered<br>
the admin password click "Add user" and enter username and<br>
password you want.<br>
<br>
<br>
And that's it! For instructions on how to use the app go to<br>
"How to use Inventar+" on the sidebar
