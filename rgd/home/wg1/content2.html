After a HUGE delay of about 3 months rgd 4.5 is finally out. Why did i skip version 4.4? Simple, this was a "major" UI remake and it was different and number 4.4 is not really pretty. New stuff that rgd 4.5 brings is: Left side navigation bar, New page buttons, more text places including one with image on home, better widget arrangement and more
