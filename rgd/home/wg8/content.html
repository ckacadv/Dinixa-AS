We have recently lost both of our domains, dinixa-as.gq and renatogr.cf. We do not know why but this is happening to all freenom users. We will try to get a new proper domain, something like .net. RGD and all other apps that used DAS no longer work out of the box. You have to make it go to https://ckacadv.github.io/Dinixa-AS/ instead of https://dinixa-as.gq/. I am working on a fixed version of rgD and also rgD 4.8. But as all this happened rgD might get replaced but i wont reveal too much
