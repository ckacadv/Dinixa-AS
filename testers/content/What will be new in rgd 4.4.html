What will be new in rgd 4.4
December 2nd 2022
New stuff in 4.4 will be remade and better made testers tab so it won't be so boring and featureless like it is in 4.3
As before you can read announcements but with better UI.
I can make a directory for example an app and in that directory i can maybe put screenshots, changelog and download
So testers tab is main focus in 4.4
