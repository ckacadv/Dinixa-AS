Updated December 3rd 2022
New stuff in 4.4 will be remade and better made testers tab so it won't be so boring and featureless like it is in 4.3
As before you can read announcements but with better UI.
I can make a directory for example an app and in that directory i can maybe put screenshots, changelog and download
Search will be better, home will be better a tiny bitty little bit, app downloading process will be in app, downloading testing app won't be so informationless like it is in 4.3 and other stuff
So testers tab is main focus in 4.4

i'll update this as i go
