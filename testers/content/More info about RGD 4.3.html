<h3>More info about RGD 4.3</h3>
<br><br>
So, RGD 4.3 has gooten muuuch more polished<br>
since last time i talked about it.<br>
Finally and officially blog is removed!!!!<br>
now on home tab you will see widgets that<br>
that will change if needed so for now there<br>
on Home tab you can see last 3 apps published,<br>
2 last news articles, most recent announcements,<br>
there is also a widget for your profile. But<br>
my account system is still very very new<br>
and unfinished and "My account" tab<br>
is also realllyyyyy empty. In future<br>
versions it will be fuller.<br>
Also i added announcement pages so if<br>
you don't have internet or there is some<br>
problem with rgd or version you are using<br>
is no longer supported app will tell you <br>
that and not just leave you with everything<br>
broken. That's it for now!<br><br>
