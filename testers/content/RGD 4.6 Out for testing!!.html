What's new in RGD 4.6
September 19th 2023
---DESIGN
There is still a side bar just like in 4.5 and most navigation is still in it, only buttons have been 
redesigned and they are bigger now like the window itself. So if you have 1366x768 display u'll have 
to move window arround to see stuff. New overall button design is changed, more rounded corners and
gradients than in previous versions. There is no more spinners for loadings, now there is indeterminate
progress bar on the bottom of the sidebar as a replacement for the spinner.

---APPS TAB
Finally apps tab is getting some attention. Apps tab is in RGD since the first version and it was 
never made properly. Untill now! Now you can read description of the program as usual, but now you
can see screenshots of it and even download it while in rgd!! While downloading you can see the
speed of the download and you can even go to a different page and a little progress bar will appear
on the top to let you know how far it has gone. It is all buggy because it was all made in less than
a day and i didnt have a whole lot of time to test and fix every problem i noticed.

---ACCOUNT SYSTEM
I also worked on the whole account system, now it has more features, its more secure and has less
flaws than the old one. Stuff is now encrypted and login system is made so passwords and usernames
aren't exposed and you can no longer log into any account with one password. Accounts that are migrated
to the new system can't be accessed by versions older than 4.6 (all that are currently out) and vice
versa. Also a new feature is notifications! Every user has its own notification wall that is not yet
automatic but it is possible to make it. Also there are public notifications (that thing on the bottom
of the sidebar on acc page), they will be used for notifying users about all kinds of things. 

---HOME TAB
I havent done much here, i will just rearrange stuff and add more boxes and make existing ones more
flexible to make them at least a little bit future proof



I'll update this as i add more stuff so remember to check the date of update!
