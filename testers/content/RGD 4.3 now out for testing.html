<h3>RGD 4.3 now out for testing</h3>
<br><br>
Finally RGD 4.3 is out for testing you can download it by clicking "Apps for testing"
and then "www.renatogr.cf Desktop 4.3" or from our discord. If you find any
bugs or some issues report it on our discord. Also now when you download it
it will come zipped for windows and do not remove anything from the folder.
If you want to place it somewhere else create a shortcut to the app and then
move it because revsecurity.dll is required for the app to work properly
and they need to be in the same folder. You of course have to extract it.
