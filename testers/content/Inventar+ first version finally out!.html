<h3>Inventar+ finally out</h3>
24.9.2023.

This project was started on 27.7.2022. and today more than a year since the annoncement i am
releasing the first version of it. This program is targeted to small businesses or people that have to manage some inventory to make it
easier. Currently only offline version is availeable but in later updates i will make a server and an online version so you can have
multiple users using and updating same lists easier. Server software should be self hosted and it should be something like rgd 3.x
server was. It may seem bad but for this purpose it will be nice. Also in some distant future when i release Kasa+ i will make them work
together so if you for example sell an item it will remove it from the list so you dont have to do it maunally.

Inventar+ uses local account system, login screen may look like an old Dinixa Account login page but it can not be used with that,
all credentials and information is saved on persons computer in an offline version.
