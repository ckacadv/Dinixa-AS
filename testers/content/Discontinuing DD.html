<h3>Discontinuing DD</h3><br><br>
Yes, it is getting discontinued but it is not even finished...
DD (Dinixa Desktop) should be a replacement for RGD because of shorter and
better name but by the time i realized that RGD was all right and i 
stopped developing it and it got discontinued and its online services are
discontinued too. It will not come back in future.
